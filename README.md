# Rubaidh's Puppet Modules

I've created a bunch of puppet modules for various client projects and I'm
getting tired duplicating them, then trying to keep changes in sync. Wherever
possible, I should be creating generic modules that I can share between
projects.

This is that set of generic modules I'm sharing between projects. It should
probably be included as a submodule or subtree merged into a target project as
needed.

It's all well and good that there's a Puppet Forge with various modules already
pre-written, but they're often not written in a way that I can reuse. However,
since I mostly control the infrastructure that I write modules for, I do get a
decent amount of reuse, once I've parameterised them to my liking.

FIXME: Insert instructions on how to make use of these modules. Probably once
I've actually done it once or twice.
